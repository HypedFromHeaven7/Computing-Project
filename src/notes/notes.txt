You can use the is function to find out if two variables are connected.
Copying doesn't break the connection between variables, you can use deep copy to truely copy variables.
(from copy import deep copy)

You can import your own modules, and use your own functions, you can then reload your modules to update changes.
(from importlib import reload)

Can use 'import * ' to import the specific function defined in the (__all__) section at the bottom of the code.
Must have the actual function names in __all__

Adding global to a variable reassigns the actual value of the variable inside a function, meaning changes in
variable x due to a function process are seen globally.

You can describe as a function using a for loop and yielding instead of returning, this saves the function's 
output as a list, that you can access with a for loop.

common courtesy to use print("Hello\nWorld"), where \n skips a line
